            <div class="subheading mb-3">Automatic Song Mapper for the VR Rhythm Game, Beat Saber</div>
            <p>
              Beat Saber is a wildly popular VR rhythm game similar to Dance Dance Revolution or Guitar Hero. While the
              officially released songs are seen as the gold standard for quality play, the desire for new content
              outstrips the rate of release of official content. In response, users have developed their own custom
              content, often hosted on websites such as <a href="https://beatsaver.com/">Beat Saver</a>. This custom
              content varies greatly in quality, and furthermore, is difficult for an ameteur user to create on their
              own. I created BeatMapSynth in an effort to enable users to quickly and reliably create their own custom
              content using generative modeling techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using over 8,000 highly-rated, user-made song mappings downloaded and processed with a custom Python
              script, I trained Hidden Markov Models to produce sequences of block placements that replicate the smooth
              transitions similar to human-made maps. By adding custom-built programming to the generative model that
              incorporates analyzed features of the music (e.g., relative loudness and song structure), I was able to
              recreate the repetition and variation in block appearance rate that are common in human-made maps. These
              custom maps can be rapidly created, played as-is, or used as the building blocks with manual map editors.

            </div>
            <p>
              Easy access to clean water is paramount to healthy communities. In order to identify water well pumps that may need updates or repairs, we created a model that predicts pump functionality in communities across Tanzania.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using records for over 50,000 Tanzanian water wells from the agency Taarifa, which aggregates the data from the Tanzania Ministry of Water, and hosted at <a href="https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/">drivendata.org</a>, we trained four independent classification models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Forest. Individually, they performed well, ~80% accuracy, but we implemented a consensus method of the four models using Soft Voting to increase the accuracy to ~82% and diminish the effects of biases in the individual models.

            <div class="subheading mb-3">Analysis of Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) to Track Unemployed, Unenrolled
              16-24 Year Olds</div>
            <p>
              Using 2017 US Census PUMS data, we provided an update to the estimate of "opportunity youth," 16 to 24 year
              olds who are neither employed nor enrolled in school, in South King Co., Washington. We compared these
              results to summarized 2014 data published <a href="https://bit.ly/2P2XRF3">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              We found the total number of opportunity youth in the defined region had decreased since the 2014 data, as
              well as a total decrease in the proportion of opportunity youth in the community. In addition, we reported that the proportion of
              opportunity youth without college experience had increased in comparison to those with some college
              experience, suggesting that previous opportunity youth were able to find employment because of their
              college experience.
